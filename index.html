# The Old Way
1. Use existing tool to grab data into Excel
2. Each person creates graphs in a different way
	- No standard
	- You might expect data in a certain format
3. You try and export to PDF, while hiding the other Excel tables you made
	- Could be by accident
	- Or because you weren't sure how to look at the data
---
# The New Way
1. Use new functionality that grabs data into Excel, and generates a PDF with
	- Graphs
	- Data Tables
	- And standard branding
2. That's it
